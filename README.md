## Instructions:
### for ISL38:
steps to execute java code:
::windows and mac syntax::
cd the folder you want to execute, then run
`java filename.java`
in the terminal, you should then see a `.class` file in the same folder. this states that your file has been ::compiled successfully::
to execute the program, run `java filename`

::ubuntu syntax::
you’ll probably work on ubuntu the most as it’s the OS installed in our Lab PC’s
to compile a java program in Ubuntu, the syntax to execute is a bit different. In Ubuntu, We’re required to state a package name at the top of our program, if it’s the 1st program, let’s call it `package p1;`
then to compile the program, we type  `javac -d . filename.java`
and to execute we type `java packagename.filename`
the above syntax is very important, so make note of it.
